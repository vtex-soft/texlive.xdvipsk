# xdvipsk (dvips+lua 2024, web2c+kpathsea 6.4.0) (TeXLive 2024)

## New options

    -g  Mode of logging into the file named DVIFILENAME.xdvips.log. Default
        on.  In case of a successful work, the log file contains the only
        message !!!Success!!!.

    -H  32-bit turbo mode for inclusion of PostScript graphics (writes EPS
        files directly to PS file) using 10 MB dynamic buffer. Default `off`.

    -I<pixel-form filters>  Resizing mode for bitmap images included with
        `em:graph` specials. Default `off`.
        <pixel-form filters> is a comma-separated tuple of up til four pairs
        <pixel form>:<filter>, where <pixel form> can be one of:
            'BW':   black/white pixels of 1-bit size
            'GR':   gray (8-bit pixels)
            'RGB':  colored 24-bit pixels
            'CMYK': colored 32-bit pixels
        and <filter> can be one of the following:
            'b':  Box filter
            't':  Bilinear filter
            'B':  B-spline filter
            'm':  Mitchell and Netravali's two-parameter bicubic filter
            'l':  Lanczos-windowed sinc filter
            'c':  Catmullâ€“Rom and Overhauser splines
            'r':  Resample image (remove rows and colums in the bitmap)
            'w1': Windows GDI filter BLACKONWHITE mode
            'w2': Windows GDI filter WHITEONBLACK mode
            'w3': Windows GDI filter COLORONCOLOR mode
            'w4': Windows GDI filter HALFTONE mode.
        Not all <pixel form>:<filter> combinations are possible:
           - filters 'w*' can be used on MS Windows systems only and just for
             BW, GR, and RGB pixel forms; for CMYK any 'w*' filter is replaced
             by 'r' filter
           - on Linux and other systems filters 'w*' are changed to 'r' filter
           - for BW graphics only filters 'r' and 'w*' are applicable

    -I (without filters)  Resizing mode with the following filter tuples:
        BW:w1,GR:w3,RGB:w3,CMYK:r  - on Windows
        BW:r,GR:r,RGB:r,CMYK:r     - on other systems.

    -j  T1 fonts partial download. Default `off` (contrary to dvips).

    -J  Download only needed characters from OT fonts. Default `on`.

    -lua `Lua` script file with optional functions: `prescan_specials(p)` and
        `scan_specials(p)` - to be used for extra processing `dvi specials`

    -W  Extended search mode for image files indicated by `em:graph` specials:
        when no file with the specified name is found, the file names with
        other extensions - `.pcx`,`.bmp`,`.tif`,`.jpg`,`.png` - are tried.
        Default `off`.

    -noluatex  Mode of disabled LuaTeX extensions. Switches off support of
        OpenType fonts. Default `on`.

    -noToUnicode  Mode without generation of maps (to Unicode) files for OT
        fonts, that can be used by Acrobat Distiller to enable text search.
        Default `on`.

    -Q  Mode of skipping VTeX specials: any content of \special commands prefixed
        with `mt:`, `vtex:`, `MC:`, `BMC:` or `EMC:` is ignored without an
        error message. Default `off`.

## New features

  *  `BMP`, `PCX`, `TIFF`, `JPEG`, `PNG` files (`BW`, `Gray`, `RGB`, `CMYK`, Indexed `RGB`),
     indicated in `TeX` special with prefix `em:graph`, are included in the
     generated `PS` file in the right way

  *  the parameter `HiResBoundingBox` is inserted in the `PS` file

  *  do not stop on unknown `\special`

  *  accepts font map `\special` commands with prefixes `mapfile` and `mapline`
     (`pdftex` primitive analoques)

  *  `Lua` callbacks for `dvi` specials (see `testdata/xdvipsk.lua` for demo)
